- npm install typescript --save-dev (install ts)

- npx tsc --init (this will create tsconfig.json)

- Build = convert your TypeScript code into JavaScript that Node.js can run 

    Node.js cannot run TypeScript. We write code in `.ts`. Node.js understands only `.js`

    Therefore, TypeScript must be compiled -> this process is called build.
